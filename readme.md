🡒 Learn JS

🡒 come to the conclusion javascript is a meme programming language.

🡒 dedicate life to JS.

🡒 be 2040, realize life's work was dedicated to a meme.

🡒 Skynet malfuctions because (0 == "") // true

🡒 - 1,000,000 LOC  + 10,000 LOC.

🡒 Make first million writing code, then first billion by deleting it.

🡒 using version control is admission that 1.0 will be bug ridden, so will 2.0, 3.0, 4.0 .... n.0

Programming is an art, and just like regular art, it thrives when it's set free 🦅.

Unlike other commodities, software creates it's own demand ( it's true for technology in general ).

Most people were not "demanding" Google / social networks before it became **operational** 🏃🏼‍♂️.

once you realize those economic realities, privateers who raise their flag to the artform become formidable foes ⚔.

Most repos you browse around here, you probably didn't realize you needed it ☺️.
